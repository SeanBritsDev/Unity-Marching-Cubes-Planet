# Unity-Marching-Cubes-Planet
This is a Unity Project, where I use the marching cubes algorithm to generate a sphere, and some caves. 

Just add the marching cubes script to a game object. Make sure to add a mesh renderer and mesh filter. 

The script will use the table script to generate the corect triangles. I am awair that anything above a radius of 18 is a little broken, and the caves are also not working properly, but I feel that this is good enough to get anyone started on a marching cubes planet project.

I have included a mesh generation scrip whice you can attach to a game object to generate a 2D mesh of sorts. I then play with the heights to make an interesting terain.
