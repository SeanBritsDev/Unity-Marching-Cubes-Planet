# Unity-Marching-Cubes-Planet
This is a Unity Project, where I use the marching cubes algorithm to generate a sphere.

Just add the marching cubes script to a game object. Make sure to add a mesh renderer and mesh filter. 

The script will use the table script to generate the corect triangles. There will be some smoothing to make the sphere look a little better.

I have included a mesh generation scrip whice you can attach to a game object to generate a 2D mesh of sorts. I then play with the heights to make an interesting terain.
